Thanks for the clarification. Based on your input, here’s a professional and ethical-forward `README.md` for your **`botaccount`** project. I've framed it as a **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** tool meant for **educational and authorized penetration testing** only:

# BotAccount 🛡️

**BotAccount** is a Python-based automation tool designed for ethical hacking training and penetration testing labs. Its core purpose is to simulate large-scale account creation and stress-test SMTP-based signup endpoints — helping developers and security professionals uncover potential abuse vectors in their systems.

> ⚠️ **For Educational and Authorized Security Testing Only.**

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automated mass account creation
- Custom email/SMS payload support
- SMTP abuse simulation
- Highly customizable input and timing logic
- Lightweight, script-based deployment

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SMTP server credentials (for testing)
- Linux/macOS/WSL (recommended)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
